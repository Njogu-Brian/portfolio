            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
           
            <p>
                My name is Brian Njogu. I am a 4th year student at JKUAT undertaking a bachelor's degree in Supply chain Mangement and a prep student at Moringa School. 
            My studies at JKUAT were cut short due to COVID-19. Our inistitution was unale to develop an online curriculum for our group. 
            this is one of the reasons I decided to join Moringa School and expand my knowledge in the world of computers.
            I have always loved computers and used them to the best of my knowledge but I have never had the understanding of code, so enrolled in Moringa to get a training on how to Code.
            
                I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
            I also practice a partime business that deals with sale of phones laptops computers and their accesories. I started this business back in 2nd Year as a way of eaning an extra penny.
            When COVID came and we were stuck in the house I decided to train myself on graphics designing in youtubr tutorials and when I was confident enough I advertised myself and got a few gigs of designing posters
            banners, flyers and video editing as well.
            With the skills i will acquire at Moringa I believe it will give me a better survival chance in our world today. 
            I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic person and I think this is a strong point of mine.
